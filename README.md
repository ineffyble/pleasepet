### Getting Started

#### Installing

Make sure you have Ruby and Rails set up beforehand.

Clone the git repo into your preferred location, and then from there run:
```
bundle install --without production
bundle exec rake db:migrate
```
This will set up the dependencies and the pet database. 

#### Running

To start the server, run `rails s` from the project directory.
